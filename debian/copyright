License: public-domain
 On October 30, 2003, Brett Roper dedicated to the public domain the
 works. Before making the dedication, Brett Roper represented that Brett Roper
 owned all copyrights in the work. By making the dedication, Brett Roper made
 an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights
 under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the works.
 .
 Brett Roper understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes the
 relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
 copyrights in the Work.
 .
 Brett Roper recognizes that, once placed in the public domain,
 the works may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
 built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or
 non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been
 invented or conceived.
Comment: The public domain statement includes a different name for each
 corresponding work, this was replaced by "the works" here to avoid
 duplicating the statement 248 times.
